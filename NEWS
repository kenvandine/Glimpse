                          In-Development
                   ------------------------------

This is the stable branch of Glimpse. Unlike earlier stable branches,
we do allow some new features here, if they are not too invasive.
Otherwise, this branch is only for bug-fixes.

Overview of Changes in Glimpse 0.1.1
====================================

* Updated translation files so they use the correct program name more often
* Glimpse is no longer incorrectly grouped with GNU I.M.P on the Windows task bar
* Fixed copyright year, versions, and AUTHORS list (as we will do in future versions)
* Move "Sponsor Contributors" list to this page so they are still included with future releases
* TO BE DETERMINED - Still in development

Overview of Changes from GNU Image Manipulation Program to Glimpse 0.1.0
========================================================================

Developer Assistance:

* Added [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) support so the code can be built
& run without needing to install the prerequisites on the host system

https://wiki.glimpse-editor.org/index.php?title=Building_Glimpse
* Improved integration with the GNOME Builder IDE

contributing guide, changelog, etc)

Quality of Life Improvements:
